m7c XMMS Skin
=============

I was experimenting with a very clean yet elegant look-and-feel and
this skin is the result. This piece of work was largely inspired by
the Opera m 7 skin. It is also based on the unix-clear XMMS skin which
is loosely based on the minEguE XMMS skin which is loosely based on
the Enlightenment minEguE theme and the XMMS Ultrafina skin.

It's quite a history :-)

Thanks to:
 - Christian Krebs [c.krebs@bluewin.ch] for the Opera m 7 skin.
 - Andr√©as Saudemont [asaudemont@voila.fr] for the minEguE XMMS skin.
 - Ben [frantb@rpi.edu] for the Enlightenment minEguE theme.
 - The unknown author of the XMMS Ultrafina skin.
